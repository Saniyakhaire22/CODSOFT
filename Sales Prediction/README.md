# Sales Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers are likely to purchase by analyzing historical data and various influencing factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and marketing platform selection.

In this project, machine learning techniques are used in **Python** to analyze sales data and predict future sales. These predictions help businesses make informed decisions, optimize advertising strategies, and maximize overall sales performance.


## 🎯 Objective
- To understand the relationship between advertising spend and sales
- To build a machine learning model for predicting sales
- To analyze and interpret data-driven insights for business decision-making
