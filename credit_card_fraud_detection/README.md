💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
It aims to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine, while handling the challenge of highly imbalanced data.

This project was completed as Task 5 during my Data Science Internship at CodSoft.

🎯 Problem Statement

Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses every year.
The objective of this project is to:

Identify fraudulent transactions

Minimize false negatives (missed fraud cases)

Improve model performance on imbalanced datasets

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE / undersampling)

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions

Target column:

0 → Genuine transaction

1 → Fraudulent transaction

Dataset is highly imbalanced, making it suitable for fraud detection modeling

⚙️ Steps Performed

Data loading and exploration

Handling missing values

Data preprocessing and normalization

Handling class imbalance using oversampling / undersampling

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Training classification models

Model evaluation using performance metrics

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier (optional if used)

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help measure how well the model identifies fraudulent transactions.

📈 Results

The trained model was able to detect fraudulent transactions effectively with improved recall and F1-score, demonstrating the importance of handling class imbalance in fraud detection problems.

🚀 Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with:

Real-world imbalanced datasets

Data preprocessing techniques

Classification algorithms

Model evaluation methods
