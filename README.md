🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

📌 Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a machine learning classification task that aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family information.
This project is designed for beginners in data science and machine learning to understand the end-to-end workflow of a real-world ML project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

🎯 Objectives
Understand and explore the Titanic dataset
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Apply feature engineering techniques
Train machine learning models for classification
Evaluate model performance and predict survival outcomes

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset (commonly available on Kaggle), which contains passenger details such as:
PassengerId
Pclass (Ticket Class)
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
Fare
Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
Survived (Target variable)

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
NumPy – Numerical computations
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

⚙️ Project Workflow
Data Loading – Importing the dataset using Pandas
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding patterns and relationships in data
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values and incorrect data
Feature Engineering – Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features
Model Building – Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
Model Evaluation – Measuring accuracy and performance metrics
Prediction – Predicting survival of passengers

📊 Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
(Optional) Random Forest / KNN

📈 Results
The model predicts passenger survival based on historical data and achieves a reasonable accuracy. 
Performance can be improved further by tuning hyperparameters and using advanced models.
